# 👋 Hey! I’m Omkar Patil (@omkarpatil14)

- 👀 I’m interested in making the web a cooler place, one bug fix at a time. 💻
- 🌱 I’m currently leveling up my powers in **Full-Stack Development** with a side quest on **System Design**. Think of it like Mario getting a mushroom 🍄, but with code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves coding, creativity, and caffeine. If your project has **React, Node.js**, and a good pun, we’re already best friends. ✨
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me battling bugs or sipping coffee on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omkar-patil-85098428a/) or send me an email at **omkarpatil9881@gmail.com**. Smoke signals also work, but response times may vary. 🕊️
- 😄 Pronouns: Code Ninja (He/Him if you’re more traditional).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a **state-level rugby player**, which means I can scrum my way through both a defense line **and** a tough coding challenge. 🏉 Also, I’ve mastered the art of googling error messages like a pro. 🔥

### A few projects I'm proud of:

- **CodeFuse**: A real-time collaborative code editor, because coding alone is fun, but coding together is *epic*. Built with **React.js, Socket.io, Node.js**, and a lot of coffee. ☕
- **Blip**: A social media app for those who believe in the power of the internet. It’s like Instagram, but with less cat pics and more cool features. 🐱

When I’m not coding or playing rugby, you’ll find me binge-watching tech videos or plotting my next side project. Let’s connect and maybe write some legendary code together! 🚀
